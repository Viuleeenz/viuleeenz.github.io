I apply it as much as I can in countless scenarios—sometimes for practical purposes, and sometimes just for fun. Recently, I’ve been diving into <strong>angr</strong>, and after weeks of banging my head against it, a few questions crossed my mind:</p><p>Has anyone ever tried using angr for something meaningful, only to end up frustrated because nothing seemed to work? Or followed an angr tutorial based on CTF code, thinking, <em>“Wow, this looks easy—I’ve got this!”</em>—only to realize you’re in way over your head?</p><p>Well, that’s exactly where I found myself. 😑</p><p>Nevertheless, I found quite interesting tutorial about symbolic execution and I really recommend the course on <a href=https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+RE3201_symexec+2021_V1/about>OpenSecurityTraining2</a>. It’s a generic course but it also gives some really good basic of angr usage. Unfortunately, what is really missing on the web (or at least I didn’t find it) is something that goes over the basic.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of the tutorial covers the following scenario: “<em>Take a binary, run it from the beginning, set few values for addresses to reach and avoid, get the result”.</em> Through this post I would like to go a little bit further from the basic and setup angr properly in order to handle a function within the binary, setting the requirements and evaluate the actual result. In my opinion this simulates a more real case scenario where you don’t really need or can’t execute the whole binary from scratch. For this post I am going to use the <strong>challenge #10</strong> of <strong>Flare-on 2024.</strong> However, instead of starting the challenge from scratch, it would be more beneficial for this tutorial to focus directly to the angr-related concepts and general requirements needed for it.</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>I’d like to point out that I always strive to create content with immediate, real-world applicability. While this post might initially seem CTF-oriented, it’s not—the challenge I’m discussing is particularly interesting because it closely resembles a “ransomware-like” binary. It involves file decryption and even a virtual machine interpreter, making it highly relevant beyond CTFs. Given the binary&rsquo;s complexity, it’s an excellent candidate for a test case. It’s also easy to obtain and far safer to experiment with than actual ransomware—perfect if you’d like to try it yourself.</em></p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>: If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, please refer to the OpenSecurityTraining2 mentioned course.</p><h3 id=delights-and-pains-of-using-angr>Delights and Pains of using Angr.</h3><p>Angr is an entirely different beast compared to the emulators I’ve covered on this blog. To be honest, <strong>angr</strong> is more like a full-featured framework for analyzing binaries through symbolic execution. The <a href=https://docs.angr.io/en/latest/>angr documentation</a> is well-structured and covers a wide range of topics in detail. However, fully grasping the documentation is no small feat—it’s far from easy.</p><p>I’ve spoken with several people who stay away from using <strong>angr</strong> because of its steep learning curve, and I have to agree—it can be challenging to get started.</p><p>To use <strong>angr</strong> effectively, there are a few key concepts you absolutely need to understand. These requirements are not so different from the prerequisites discussed earlier on this blog for working with emulators. However, with <strong>angr</strong>, you also need to thoroughly understand <strong>what symbolic execution is and how it works.</strong></p><p>The most critical step, though, is setting up <strong>angr</strong> correctly—especially when you need to focus on a specific piece of code rather than running the entire binary from the beginning.</p><p>Having an idea of angr components and capabilities we could simplify its usage in two main cases:</p><ol><li>You need to symbolically execute the <strong>binary from scratch</strong> in order to understand <em><strong>which input could lead to a specific output</strong></em>. (Basic usage)</li><li>You need to symbolically execute a <strong>function within the binary</strong> in order to understand the result of this function, <strong>setting up all the requirements</strong> (parameters) <strong>that are going to be used during the execution</strong>.</li></ol><p>When you run a binary with <strong>angr</strong>, you’ll rely on these components to find a “solution” that meets your specific needs. This solution could take many forms—it might be identifying a bug in a program to report an error, or it could be something entirely different, such as uncovering a passphrase or a product key</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>Before diving into our example, you might wonder: “How can I determine if this function, or my goal, is a good fit for angr?” This is a great question, but unfortunately, it doesn’t have a straightforward answer. Generally speaking, you can use <strong>angr</strong> whenever you’re faced with a question like: “What input would produce this specific output?” While this isn’t a complete guideline, I’ve found that this question often arises when I encounter problems well-suited for an <strong>angr-like</strong> solution. That said, you also need to carefully consider the function or binary you plan to analyze. Since emulation is inherently slow, working with <strong>angr</strong> can lead to exponentially increasing complexity and execution time, depending on the task.</em></p><p><em>My recommendation is to use <strong>angr</strong> for well-defined, specific tasks that align with the question above, rather than attempting to run it against the entire binary.</em></p></blockquote><h3 id=c4tbert--vs-angr>C4tbert Vs. Angr</h3><p>C4tbert is one of the most enjoyable challenges I’ve had the chance to tackle recently. It covers a variety of fascinating topics, including UEFI, cryptography, and virtual machines. In short, the goal is to find the correct passwords that will eventually decrypt files containing parts of the flag.</p><p><img src=../../../../img/symbolic_exe/decrypt_file.png alt="Figure 1: Catbert Ransomware - attempt to decrypt file with random password"></p><p>Figure 1: Catbert Ransomware - attempt to decrypt file with random password</p><p>Does this sound familiar? It aligns perfectly with the question we discussed earlier: <em>“What input would produce this output?”</em> To answer this question using <strong>angr</strong>, we first need to explore the code, develop a high-level understanding of the input and output parameters, and define all the necessary requirements.</p><p>Let’s start reversing a bit the interesting part of the binary avoiding to look closer on the challenge itself, but let’s try to focus on angr requirements.</p><p><img src=../../../../img/symbolic_exe/code_overview.png alt="Figure 2: Decryption overview for angr requitements "></p><p>Figure 2: Decryption overview for angr requitements</p><blockquote><p>💡 <em>To make it easier to follow, I have renamed most of the code. So it will be also possible to use line number as a reference.</em></p></blockquote><p>Looking at <strong>Figure 2</strong>, we can see that at <strong>line 170</strong>, the <strong>password</strong> is checked to ensure it is <strong>16 characters long</strong>. Before this, a <strong>bytecode</strong> is retrieved from a file (<strong>line 163</strong>) and later manipulated slightly (<strong>lines 180–194</strong>) by substituting some of its characters with values derived from our input key. Finally, the bytecode is passed to a <strong>virtual_machine_interpreter</strong> for processing. Based on these observations, we can start taking notes of the requirements we’ve uncovered so far and translate them into practical actions we need to perform with <strong>angr</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Bytecode</strong>: We need to allocate memory to hold the bytecode, which can be easily retrieved from the <code>.c4tb</code> file.</li><li><strong>Password</strong>: This is the answer to our problem. We need to find a 16-character input that can successfully decrypt the file.</li></ul><p>Additionally, we must keep in mind that the <strong>password is mixed into the bytecode</strong> during its processing by the <strong>bytecode interpreter</strong> function. With a more clear understanding of those points, we can now move on to exploring the virtual machine code, which represents the part of the program we will execute</p><p><img src=../../../../img/symbolic_exe/vm_code.png alt="Figure 3: Requirements for virtual_machine_interpreter function."></p><p>Figure 3: Requirements for virtual_machine_interpreter function.</p><p>To determine the function&rsquo;s requirements, we need to start our exploration from the very beginning. As we can see, the function involves a <strong>bytecode</strong> (which we’ve already noted), a <strong>status</strong> (representing the exit condition, as referenced in Figure 3), and a <strong>stack</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>💡<em>To keep things simple, I’ve referred to the additional memory needed in the function as a <strong>stack</strong>. You might ask, “How am I supposed to know that a stack is needed without analyzing the function?” Well, a stack is essentially just a block of memory. It’s called a <strong>stack</strong> because it’s typically accessed via a register pointing to it, but in general, we could call it anything we like. It’s important to note that I made this simplification to make the overall structure easier to understand. If you’re interested in reversing the code in detail, you’ll eventually discover that the virtual machine interpreter performs various operations on the stack, such as <strong>push</strong>, <strong>pop</strong>, <strong>rotate</strong>, and more.</em></p></blockquote><p>To effectively use <strong>angr</strong>, especially in our case, it’s crucial to identify the correct address to begin execution. Fortunately, this is straightforward in this scenario, as it corresponds to the very first instruction of the <strong>virtual_machine_interpreter</strong> (<strong>line 16</strong>).</p><p>Another important aspect to consider when running an <strong>angr</strong> script are the <strong>find</strong> and <strong>avoid</strong> addresses. These special addresses represent success and failure conditions, respectively. However, instead of just specifying a simple address, you can also define a function to check the <strong>status</strong> variable in order to determine its value and any potential success condition. Looking at the code, we can easily see that if <strong>status</strong> equals 0, the program will follow the invalid key branch.</p><p>Now that we have a general understanding of the code, we can begin writing our <strong>angr</strong> script.</p><h3 id=writing-angr-script>Writing angr script</h3><p>Let’s start writing down the requirements that we have discovered.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>

When executing code, it&rsquo;s crucial to align the addresses from the program with those in your disassembler or debugger if you want to track the program&rsquo;s flow accurately. In this case, <strong>angr</strong> loads the program into specific memory addresses. To set these variables correctly, you can retrieve the addresses used by <strong>angr</strong> and rebase the binary in <strong>IDA</strong> accordingly. After initializing the project, you can print the base address used by <strong>angr</strong> to get this information.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>base_addr <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> proj<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>loader<span style=color:#f92672>.</span>min_addr

While there are still unexplored topic (e.g., Qiling), I haven’t delved into it deeply. Despite being a potentially powerful tool, Qiling’s documentation isn’t well-maintained, and utilizing it might require significant effort. Nevertheless, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading all the posts and had as much fun exploring them as I did while explaining and experimenting with these topics.</p><p>Recently, I’ve received a few messages asking why I stopped publishing on the blog. The truth is, most of my recent research has focused on very specific topics that might not appeal to a broad audience. Writing blog posts for such a niche can sometimes feel less beneficial for a general readership. So, what does the future hold?</p><p>I don’t want to stop publishing entirely, even though I’ve been a bit inconsistent lately. However, I’m still figuring out which topics could be interesting to explore in the coming months. I enjoy exploring new ideas and conducting independent research on malware analysis and classification. I usually try to align this blog with my research, both to clarify my own thoughts and to provide useful content for a wider audience.</p><p>At the moment, I have a few large projects under development that are keeping me quite busy. Still, I’m considering posting research-oriented content related to malware classification, possibly adopting a more formal, paper-oriented format (which I’d include in the whitepapers section). As for the future, it remains uncertain. As the saying goes, <em>“The best way to predict the future is to create it.”</em> I’ll continue exploring, experimenting, and sharing whenever inspiration strikes or a project feels worth sharing.</p><p>Thank you for reading, and as always, keep reversing and have fun!</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><ul><li><a href=https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/flare-on11-challenge10-catbert-ransomware.pdf>Flare-on Challenge</a></li><li><a href=https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+RE3201_symexec+2021_V1/about>SymbolicExecution training</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/Viuleeenz/Reversing_Notes/blob/main/SymbolicExecution/catbert_ransomware.py>Catbert Ransomware solver</a></li></ul></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>
