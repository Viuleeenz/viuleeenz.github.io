                <p>Who am I? My name is Alessandro Strino and since my adolescence everything related to security has captured my attention, however, starting as OffSec addicted, I moved to malware analysis a few years later, where I have also started to write patches or exploits for fun and no profit.

<p>Anyway, I have spent a good amount of time securing enterprise networks and products. This blog was born to help people interested in security topics to learn (hopefully) something new. However, it also represents a chance to <strong>give something back to the community</strong>. I’ll try to keep it update with good contents that are related to my area of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverse Engineering</li>
<li>Malware Analysis (Mobile | Windows)</li>
<li>Computer Forensic</li>
<li>(little) Exploit Development</li>
</ul>
<p>About my background, I have taken a Master’s Degree in Computer Security at University of Salerno (Italy) in 2017 and I also have spent a year at DFire LAB in Dublin as a researcher for my master thesis.</p>
<p>During my spare time, I like to challenge myself with challenges related to: reversing, malware analysis, forensic stuffs.Nevertheless, by doing troubleshooting on issues at work, I became Hokage of extreme pentesting conditions and routing issues :D )</p>
<p>My proof-of-concepts can be found, together with my other projects, on my GitHub account under the name of <a href="https://github.com/Viuleeenz">Viuleeenz</a>. To contact me, you can e-mail me at [al.strino][at][gmail][dot][com], or DM on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/viuleeenz">@Viuleeenz</a>.</p>
