This blog was born to help people interested in security topics to learn (hopefully) something new. However, it also represents a chance to <strong>give something back to the community</strong>. I’ll try to keep it update with good contents that are related to my area of interest:</p><ul><li>Reverse Engineering</li><li>Malware Analysis (Mobile | Windows)</li><li>Computer Forensic</li><li>(little) Exploit Development</li></ul><p>About my background, I have taken a Master’s Degree in Computer Security at University of Salerno (Italy) in 2017 and I also have spent a year at DFire LAB in Dublin as a researcher for my master thesis.</p><p>During my spare time, I like to challenge myself with challenges related to: reversing, malware analysis, forensic stuffs.Nevertheless, by doing troubleshooting on issues at work, I became Hokage of extreme pentesting conditions and routing issues :D )</p><p>My proof-of-concepts can be found, together with my other projects, on my GitHub account under the name of <a href=https://github.com/Viuleeenz>Viuleeenz</a>.
