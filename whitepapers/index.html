<h3 id="the-android-malwares-journey-from-google-play-to-banking-fraud"><strong>The Android Malware’s Journey: From Google Play to banking fraud</strong></h3>
<p>During the last years, the number of Android banking trojans has increased, and new techniques to perform banking fraud have been developed. Although most of the banking trojans are distributed via *ishing campaigns, TAs also use official app stores to deliver their malware using dropper applications, namely an application designed to download malware into the target device.</p>

<h3 id="brata-is-evolving-into-an-advanced-persistent-threat"><strong>BRATA is evolving into an Advanced Persistent Threat</strong></h3>
<p>Threat Actors behind BRATA, now target a specific financial institution at a time, and change their focus only once the targeted victim starts to implement consistent countermeasures against them. Then, they move away from the spotlight, to come out with a different target and strategies of infections. At first glance, it seems to be a good strategy with a relevant pay off. However, it’s important to point out also the struggles and the plan needed to apply this pattern.</p>
